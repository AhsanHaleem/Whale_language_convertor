# Whale_language_convertor
💬 A program like a popular coding problem Caesar Cipher. 

This program converts english human lanuguage to the whale language, the result is whale song sung slowly.

It takes a phrase like "turpentine and turtles" and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent, "uueeieeauuee" using loops and vectors.
The vowels are taken out from the phase and 'u' and 'e' are doubled.
